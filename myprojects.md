### [When are you free?](https://github.com/SimpleSnippet/WhenRUFree-iOS.git)
This is a small hackathon project that I worked on over at HackNY.  The idea is it's an iOS application that can tell you when your friends are free to hang out with you.  It was inspired by me having to deal with trying to handle all of my friends schedules so I can find time to catch up with them here and there and create stronger friendships.
Features:

- Location Tracking 
- So you can find a location to meet up with your friend
- Venmo
- To Split the Bill if you went out to eat with your friend
- Notification Service
- So you each get a notification when you're both free and want to hang




### [Project Flop](https://github.com/SimpleSnippet/ProjectFlop.git)
Another hackathon project from Unhackathon in AlleyNYC.  This project is a small Javascript game I made in the last 4 hours of the hackathon.  It generates blocks from one side of the screen and the goal is to see you block on the other side survive by destroying the other blocks with bullets
Features:

- Geonometric Movement of the blocks
- Increase block spawn rate and speed per level
- Movement with arrow keys and shoot with space bar 
- See how long you can survive!



### [Rutgers Robotic Hackathon](https://github.com/SimpleSnippet/RoboticsHackathon.git)
A project made for the Rutgers Robotic Hackathon.  The hackathon required having a robot that consisted of a claw, camera, wheels, and infrered sensor, Arduino, and Raspberry.  The goal was to pick up and place the most ping pong balls into your goal while you compete with 3 other robots in the same ring.  This project ended up winning first place.
Features:

- Built in native C
- VR programmed through the camera to detect the distane and placement of a ball
- Speed and wall collision contorlled by the inrered sensor
- Claw activated by camera
- Driving AI programmed using demensions of the playing field



### [Maple Me Game](https://github.com/SimpleSnippet/MapleMeGame.git)

Features:

- Built in native Java
- Sprites generated form Maple Me
