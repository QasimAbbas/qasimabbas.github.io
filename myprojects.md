### [When are you free?]https://github.com/SimpleSnippet/WhenRUFree-iOS.git
This is a small hackathon project that I worked on over at HackNY.  The idea is it's an iOS application that can tell you when your friends are free to hang out with you.  It was inspired by me having to deal with trying to handle all of my friends schedules so I can find time to catch up with them here and there and create stronger friendships.
Features:
- Location Tracking 
-- So you can find a location to meet up with your friend
-Venmo
--To Split the Bill if you went out to eat with your friend
-Notification Service
--So you each get a notification when you're both free and want to hang
