## Arrays

So let's start out with Arrays.  Imagine having a box of space.  Let's bring that down to a cardboard UPS box.  There is no way that box is getting any bigger.  It's made that way.  If you need more space you'll need a bigger box man unless you pull some Package Engineering magic and make extra space with the same box out of your wonderful eqautions .

What do we use boxes for initially?  To store things silly!  I'm assuming you all know the basic primitives and common use objects such as Ints, Doubles, Floats, Strings.

(quick run down, "hell yeah")

* Ints
 * These are your generic numbers.  No decimal places, it basically cuts that straight off.
 * Let's see what this looks like in action!

``` python
 num = 1
 ```
