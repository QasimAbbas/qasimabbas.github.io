# Define: iOS Developer

To put it simply, I am an **iOS Developer**.  I bet you could have figured that out through my title on this page, right?  But how would you know how to define an iOS Developer?  
                            
Here is my definition:  an iOS Developer is someone who has a love and understanding of all aspects of technology.  
                            
There is firstly an understanding of **design** that influences **user interface and experience** so users from any and all ages and backgrounds, can have as many intuitive interactions as possible. 
                            
An understanding of **writing code** that not only is **efficient** enough for programmers to interpret in a very brisk way but enough for a very minuscule piece of hardware to handle by covering all bases of lower level computing from **memory management** and **CPU energy usage**, each being a critical aspect by having massive effects on battery if not monitored with the utmost precision.  

An understanding of **managing** and **securing data** storage and transfer on devices through means of encryption and authentication patterns, while still being able to make transactions lightweight and very fast for users to access information through inventive **algorithms** and **structures**.
                            
In addition to all of this,  an **iOS Developer** sits on the cusp of a rapidly changing environment with new languages, tools, and hardwares delivered on an annual basis.  The only way one can fathom being on top of all of this is to, as with any field, have a love for what they do.

As a famous author once told it, "Yes, I’ve made a great deal of dough from my fiction, but I never set a single word down on paper with the thought of being paid for it … I have written because it fulfilled me. Maybe it paid off the mortgage on the house and got the kids through college, but those things were on the side—I did it for the buzz. I did it for the pure joy of the thing. And if you can do it for the joy, you can do it forever." - Stephen King
